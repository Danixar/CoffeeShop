# CoffeeShop

CMPT 353 - November 2020

## Coffee Shop Full Stack App

PartA is the version using incredibly basic HTML/JavaScript, Node Javascript, and MySQL for the client, server, and database, respectively.

PartD is the MERN version using React TypeScript, Node Typescript, and MongoDB for the client, server, and database, respectively.

## To run either:

1. cd into the directory of the chosen part
2. `docker-compose up -d -build` - if this doesn't work try adding the `--force-recreate` option or just using `docker-compose up`
3. Access for partA's browser is through port 80 while partD's browser is through port 3000
4. when done `docker-compose down`

# CoffeeShop

**November/December 2020**

Four implementations of a very basic coffee shop full stack application. Each version explores new technologies as a method of learning.

## Coffee Shop Full Stack App

**PartA** is the version using incredibly basic HTML/JavaScript, Node Javascript, and MySQL for the client, server, and database, respectively.

**PartB** is the MERN version using React TypeScript, Node Typescript, and MongoDB for the client, server, and database, respectively.

**PartC (In Progress)** is the version utilizing Vue TypeScript, Deno TypeScript, and MongoDB for the client, server, and database, respectively.

## To run either:

1. cd into the directory of the chosen part
2. `docker-compose up -d -build` - if this doesn't work try adding the `--force-recreate` option or just using `docker-compose up`
3. Access for partA's browser is through port 80 while partB's browser is through port 3000
4. when done `docker-compose down`
